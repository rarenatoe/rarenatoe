These are my most used languages as computed by the `https://github-readme-stats-five-silk.vercel.app`, however I consider my knowledge in Python as deep as my TypeScript experience, perhaps more.

I am the creator of [more-or-less](https://github.com/rarenatoe/more-or-less), a component written in TypeScript for expanding/collapsing paragraphs in React Native, which accomplishes everything in just 2 renders.

As a hobby, I create Svelte templates for various purposes. For example, check out my [wedding-svelte-template](https://github.com/rarenatoe/wedding-svelte-template).
