### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Renato Alegre

I am a software developer with a broad background in backend development with **.NET** and **Python**, as well as **GraphQL**. Life, however, threw me lemons in the form of React Native, where I now focus on building clean and highly performant user interfaces.

I am the creator of **[react-native-markdown-x](https://github.com/rarenatoe/react-native-markdown-x)**, a React Native component for parsing and rendering markdown. My work also includes **[react-native-more-or-less-text](https://github.com/rarenatoe/react-native-more-or-less-text)**, a component that intelligently expands and collapses text with just two renders.

As a hobby, I create **Svelte** templates for various purposes, such as my popular **[wedding-svelte-template](https://github.com/rarenatoe/wedding-svelte-template)**.

Feel free to connect with me!
